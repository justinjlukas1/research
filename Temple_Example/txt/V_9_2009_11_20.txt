Overview  Visa operates the worlds largest retail electronic payments network and manages a leading global payments brand. We have more branded credit and debit cards in circulation, more transactions and greater total volume than any of our competitors. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. We provide financial institutions, our primary customers, with product platforms encompassing consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments. VisaNet, our secure, centralized, global processing platform, enables us to provide financial institutions and merchants with a wide range of product platforms, transaction processing and related value-added services.  Our business primarily consists of the following:            we own, manage and promote a family of well-known, widely accepted payment brands, including Visa, Visa Electron, PLUS and Interlink, which we license to our customers for use in their payment programs;            we offer a wide range of branded payments product platforms, which our customers use to develop and offer credit, debit, prepaid and cash access programs for cardholders (individuals, businesses and government entities);            we provide transaction processing and value-added services to our customers through VisaNet, Visa Debit Processing Services and Visa Processing Services;            we invest in new services and processing platforms to facilitate more convenient and innovative payment methods, such as mobile payments and eCommerce;            we continually improve the security of our network and our payments services to improve the reliability of our global processing infrastructure and the security of cardholder information; and            we adopt and enforce a common set of rules adhered to by our customers to ensure the efficient and secure functioning of our payments network and the maintenance and promotion of our brands.  We derive revenues primarily from fees paid by our customers based on payments volume, transactions that we process and certain other related services that we provide.  In fiscal 2009:            we launched our first global advertising campaign, entitled More people go with Visa. The new campaign enables us to align our worldwide marketing under a single theme that highlights the superior value Visa delivers versus cash and checks and enables us to achieve cost efficiencies by consolidating our global marketing efforts;            we brought online our largest and most sophisticated global data center, and decommissioned an older facility;            we formed Visa Processing Services Pte. Ltd., or VPS, a joint venture with Yalamanchili International Pte. Ltd., a payments processor and software company with operations in Asia. We expect VPS to extend multi-currency and multi-language debit, credit and prepaid processing capabilities to financial institutions, processors and payment companies outside of the United States;    4    Table of Contents         we, along with U.S. Bank, formed a joint venture named Syncada, a global payment network that delivers a proven integrated invoice processing, payment and financing platform for financial institutions to offer to their corporate and government commercial clients around the world; and            we sold our 10% ownership in Companhia Brasileira de Meois de Pagamento, or VisaNet do Brasil, in connection with its initial public offering. Following the initial public offering, we amended an existing agreement with VisaNet do Brasil that grants a license to use our trademarks and technology intellectual property.  Our Reorganization and Initial Public Offering  Visa Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware stock corporation in May 2007 and the Visa global enterprise was reorganized in October 2007. Prior to the reorganization, Visa operated as five corporate entities related by ownership and membership. For more information on our reorganization, see Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 2The Reorganization.  In March 2008, we completed our Initial Public Offering, or IPO. As a result of our IPO, the financial institutions that hold our class B and class C common stock represent a minority of the outstanding shareholder interest of Visa Inc. For more information about our IPO, our capital structure and our classes of common stock, see Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 15Stockholders Equity.  Industry Overview  The Global Payments Industry   We operate in the global payments industry, which is undergoing a major shift from paper-based payments, such as cash and checks, to card-based and other electronic payments. For more than 30 years, Visa has played a central role in driving this migration by providing payment products and services that we believe deliver significant benefits to consumers, businesses, governments and merchants. We believe that consumers are increasingly attracted to the convenience, security, enhanced services and rewards associated with electronic payment forms. We also believe that corporations and governments are shifting to electronic payments to improve efficiency, control and security, and that a growing number of merchants are accepting electronic payments to improve sales and customer convenience.  The global payments industry consists of all forms of payment and value transfer, including:            paper-based paymentscash, personal checks, money orders, government checks, travelers cheques, official checks and other paper-based means of transferring value;            card-based paymentscredit cards, charge cards, debit cards, deferred debit cards, ATM cards, prepaid cards, private label cards and other types of general-purpose and limited-use cards; and            other electronic paymentswire transfers, electronic benefits transfers, automated clearing house payments and other forms of electronic payment not typically tied to a payment card or similar access device.  The most common card-based forms of payment are general-purpose cards, which offer widespread merchant acceptance. General purpose cards are typically categorized as:            pay now cards, such as debit cards, which enable the cardholder to purchase goods and services by an automatic debit to a checking, demand deposit or other current account;    5    Table of Contents         pay later cards, such as credit, deferred debit and charge cards, which typically permit a cardholder to carry a balance in a revolving credit or deferred debit account or require payment of the full balance within a specified period; and            pay before cards, such as prepaid cards, which are prefunded up to a certain monetary value.  The primary global general purpose card brands include Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, JCB and Diners Club. While these brandsincluding Visawere historically associated primarily with consumer credit or charge cards in the United States and other major international markets, Visa and others have, over time, broadened their offerings to include debit, ATM, prepaid and commercial cards.  Our Primary Operations  We generate revenue from the transaction processing services we offer to our customers. Our customers deliver Visa products and payment services to consumers and merchants based on the product platforms we define and manage. Payments network management is a core part of our operations, as it ensures that our payments system provides a safe, efficient, consistent, and interoperable service to cardholders, merchants, and financial institutions worldwide.  Transaction Processing Services  Processing Infrastructure  We own and operate VisaNet, which consists of three synchronized processing centers, including a new data center on the east coast of the United States that replaced an existing data center in March 2009. In addition, Visa Europe operates one processing center in the United Kingdom, which is part of our synchronized system in accordance with the terms of our Framework Agreement with Visa Europe. These centers are linked by a global telecommunications network and are engineered for redundancy. Intelligent access points around the world complete our global processing infrastructure and enable merchants and financial institutions worldwide to access our core processing and value-added services.  VisaNet is built on a centralized architecture, enabling us to view and analyze each authorization transaction we process in real time and provide value-added information, such as risk scoring or loyalty applications, while the transaction data is being routed through our system.  Core Processing Services  Our core processing services involve the routing of payment information and related data to facilitate the authorization, clearing and settlement of transactions between Visa issuers, which are the financial institutions that issue Visa cards to cardholders, and acquirers, which are the financial institutions that offer Visa network connectivity and payments acceptance services to merchants. In addition, we offer a range of value-added processing services to support our customers Visa programs and to promote the growth and security of the Visa payments network.  Authorization is the process of approving or declining a transaction before a purchase is finalized or cash is disbursed. Clearing is the process of delivering final transaction data from an acquirer to an issuer for posting to the cardholders account, the calculation of certain fees and charges that apply to the issuer and acquirer involved in the transaction, and the conversion of transaction amounts to the appropriate settlement currencies. Settlement is the process of calculating, determining, reporting and transferring the net financial position of our issuers and acquirers for all transactions that are cleared.    6    Table of Contents The issuer and acquirer involved in a typical Visa transaction perform additional functions that we do not generally perform or monitor. For example, the acquirer credits the merchants account for the amount of the transaction less any fees the acquirer charges in accordance with the contractual agreement between the merchant and the acquirer. In addition, the issuer sends a statement to the cardholder and collects payment, in the case of a credit or deferred debit card, or collects payment directly from the cardholders deposit account, in the case of a debit card.  We process virtually all Visa transactions occurring in the United States. We also process virtually all Visa cross-border transactions (that is, transactions where the issuer and the merchant are located in different countries). In many countries outside the United States, domestic transactions may be processed outside of our systems, generally by government-controlled payments networks, our financial institution customers, independent companies or joint ventures owned in whole or in part by our financial institution customers.  We perform clearing and settlement through VisaNet for transactions involving an issuer that is located in Visa Europes region and an acquirer that is located in the rest of the world, or vice versa. In addition, we currently provide clearing and settlement services for Visa transactions occurring entirely within Visa Europes region and will continue to provide such services until completion and deployment of Visa Europes own processing system which is expected to be fully deployed in fiscal 2010. The impact to our consolidated financial results as a result of this deployment is not expected to be material. Visa Europe authorizes transactions for its members through its own processing system.  Other Value-Added Processing Services  We offer a range of other value-added services in certain countries, including risk management, debit issuer processing, loyalty services, dispute management and value-added information services.  Risk Management Services. We provide customers in certain countries with a number of value-added risk-management services. These services, including Visa Advanced Authorization, include preventive, monitoring, investigative and predictive tools, which are intended to mitigate and help eliminate fraud at the cardholder and merchant level.  Issuer Processing Services. Visa Debit Processing Services, or DPS, provides comprehensive issuer processing services for participating U.S. issuers of Visa debit, prepaid and ATM payment products. In addition to core issuer authorization processing, DPS offers card management services, exception processing, PIN and ATM network gateways, call center services, fraud detection services and ATM terminal driving. Through VPS, we provide credit, debit and prepaid issuer processing services, including multicurrency processing functionality, outside the United States.  Loyalty Services. We offer loyalty services, such as the Visa Incentive Network and Visa Extras, that allow our customers to differentiate their Visa program offerings, enhance the attractiveness of their Visa payment programs and strengthen their relationships with cardholders and merchants.  Dispute Management Services. We manage Visa Resolve Online, an automated web-based service that allows our customers back-office analysts and customer service representatives to manage and resolve Visa transaction disputes more efficiently than with paper-based processes.  Value-Added Information Services. We provide our customers with a range of additional information-based business analytics and applications, as well as the transaction data and associated infrastructure required to support them.    7    Table of Contents Product Platforms  We offer a broad range of product platforms to enable our customers to build differentiated, competitive payment programs for their consumer, business, government and merchant clients. Our principal payment platforms enable credit, charge, deferred debit, debit and prepaid payments, as well as cash access, for consumers, businesses and government entities. Our payment platforms are offered under our Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and PLUS brands.  Consumer Credit  Our consumer credit product platforms allow our issuers to offer deferred payment and financing products that can be customized to meet the needs of all consumer segments. Our baseline consumer credit platform is marketed to our issuers as Visa Classic. In addition, we offer premium credit platforms, which enable our issuers to tailor programs to consumers requiring higher credit lines or enhanced benefits, such as loyalty programs. Our premium consumer credit platforms are marketed to issuers, and in some cases, to cardholders, as Visa Gold, Visa Platinum, Visa Signature, Visa Signature Preferred and Visa Infinite.  Consumer Deposit Access  Our deposit access product platforms enable our issuers to offer consumer payment and cash access products that draw upon consumer deposit accounts, such as checking, demand deposit, asset or other pre-funded accounts.  Consumer Debit. Our primary consumer debit platform in the United States and many other countries uses the Visa brand mark. Our customers in Asia Pacific, or AP, Latin America and Caribbean, or LAC, and Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, or CEMEA, can use the Visa Electron debit platform, which permits issuers to require all transactions initiated from the card to be authorized electronically. It is primarily used by issuers offering payment programs to higher risk customer segments or in countries where electronic authorization is less prevalent. In the United States, we also provide the Interlink debit product platform, which generally requires a cardholder to enter a personal identification number, or PIN, for authentication. Interlink may be enabled through an acceptance mark on a Visa debit card or issued as a standalone debit card.  Prepaid. Our prepaid product platform enables issuers to offer products that access a pre-funded account, allowing cardholders to enjoy the convenience and security of a payment card in lieu of cash or checks. Our prepaid platform includes gift, travel, youth, payroll, money transfer, corporate incentive, insurance reimbursement and government benefits cards.  Cash Access. Our customers can provide global cash access to their cardholders by issuing products accepted at Visa and PLUS branded ATMs. Most Visa and Visa Electron branded cards offer customers cash access at ATMs, as well as at branches of our participating financial institution customers. The PLUS brand may also be included on issuers non-Visa branded cards to offer international cash access as a complement to domestic cash access services.  Commercial  Our commercial product platforms enable multinational, large, medium and small companies and government organizations to streamline payment processes, manage total spend, access information reporting, automate their supply chain, and reduce administrative costs.  Small Businesses. The Visa Business credit and debit platforms provide small businesses with cash flow tools, purchasing savings, rewards and management reporting. Visa Business Electron is an electronic authorization platform used in many countries outside North America.    8    Table of Contents Large and Medium Companies. The Visa Corporate platform offers payment options primarily for employee travel and entertainment charges, including cash advances, and provides detailed transaction data as well as information and expense management tools. The Visa Purchasing platform provides card and non-card electronic payment products that allow companies to easily procure goods and services, while streamlining resource- and paper-intensive purchase order and invoice processing. The Visa Fleet platform offers a fuel and ground fleet-related payment program, including extensive transaction detail and tax reclamation services. Through Syncada, our joint venture with US Bank, we market an integrated invoice processing, payment and financing platform for financial institutions to offer to their corporate and government commercial clients around the world.  Government Organizations. In addition to the products mentioned above, Visa offers government organizations unique information-and expense-management tools, employee-fraud-and misuse-management tools and strategic sourcing tools for their card programs. In certain countries, Visa offers specialized commercial products for specific government-sponsored programs, typically targeting agriculture, small-business, freight or construction loan programs.  Product Platform Innovation  We invest in the development and enhancement of payment product platforms with the goal of increasing the migration of consumer and business spending to electronic payments. We believe that innovation results in more secure and versatile payment program options for customers, merchants and consumers. We focus on new payment channels, card technologies, payment account access devices and authentication methods, and have recently made significant investments in the development of eCommerce payment platforms; contact and contactless chip cards and devices; card product enhancements; authentication and security technologies and platforms; and money transfer.  Payments Network Management  We devote significant resources to ensure that Visa is the payments network of choice for customers, merchants and cardholders. We seek to accomplish this by promoting our brand through marketing and sponsorship activities, increasing acceptance of Visa cards around the world and ensuring that the system operates reliably and securely for all of our network participants.  Brand Management and Promotion  We engage in a variety of activities designed to maintain and enhance the value of our brand. Our integrated approach to brand management and promotion combines advertising, sponsorships, promotions and public relations to create programs that build active preference for products carrying our brand, promote product usage, increase product acceptance and support cardholder acquisition and retention. For merchants, we work to ensure that the Visa brand represents timely and guaranteed payment, as well as a way to increase sales. For our customers, our marketing is designed to support their card issuance, activation and usage efforts while complementing and enhancing the value of their own brands. For cardholders, we work to ensure that Visa is a symbol of security, convenience and acceptance.  We establish global marketing relationships to promote the Visa brand and to allow customers to conduct marketing programs in conjunction with major sporting and entertainment events. Our primary global sponsorship platforms are the Olympic Games, for which we have been the exclusive payment card sponsor since 1986, and the FIFA World Cup. Through these marketing relationships, our customers may develop marketing programs that include the Visa brand and mention our sponsorship status. In addition, we engage in marketing and sponsorship activities with other regional, national and local companies, sports leagues or events, such as the National Football League in the United States, or with associations and companies, to provide customized marketing platforms to customers in certain countries and regions.    9    Table of Contents Our merchant marketing activities bring added value to our merchant partners through the development of marketing programs customized for specific merchants and industry segments. These programs, which we develop in conjunction with merchants, generate awareness for new acceptance channels and locations and increase cardholder spending and merchant sales revenue through special offers and promotions.  Merchant Acceptance Initiatives  We aim to maintain and expand our merchant base by focusing on the needs of merchants and consumers and enhancing our programs to increase acceptance in attractive and fast-growing segments, such as bill payment. Our efforts to address these needs include supporting the development of technological innovations, delivering value-added information services, such as the Visa Incentive Network, and evaluating potential modifications to our operating rules and interchange rates to enhance the value of our payments network compared to other forms of payment.  We enter into arrangements with certain merchants under which they receive monetary incentives and rebates for acceptance of products carrying our brands and increasing their payments volume of products carrying our brands or indicating a preference for our cards.  Customer Standards  Our customers are generally required to be financial institutions or other deposit-taking institutions organized under local banking laws or wholly-owned by such institutions. Certain of our customers participate in the full range of functions available to participants in the Visa network, such as soliciting cardholders and issuing cards, soliciting and signing merchants and acquiring merchant transactions. These financial institutions may also sponsor other financial institutions for more limited participation in our network.  Rulemaking and Enforcement  In general, our customers are granted licenses to use our brands and to access our transaction processing systems. Our customers are obligated to honor our rules and standards through agreements with, and in certain cases non-equity membership interests in, our subsidiaries. These rules and standards relate to such matters as the use of our brands and trademarks, the standards, design and features of payment cards and programs, merchant acquiring activities, including acceptance standards applicable to merchants, use of agents, disputes between members, risk management, guaranteed settlement, customer financial failures and allocation of losses among customers.  We establish dispute management procedures between customers relating to specific transactions. For example, after a transaction is presented to an issuer, the issuer may determine that the transaction is invalid for a variety of reasons, including fraud. If the issuer believes there is a defect in a transaction, the issuer may return, or charge back, the transaction to the acquirer. We enforce rules relating to chargebacks and maintain a dispute resolution process with respect to chargeback disputes.  Credit Risk Management  We indemnify our customers for any settlement loss suffered due to another customers failure to fund its daily settlement obligations. In certain instances, we may indemnify customers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system. No material loss related to settlement risk has been incurred in recent years.    10    Table of Contents To manage our exposure in the event our customers fail to fund their settlement obligations, we have a credit risk policy with a formalized set of credit standards and risk control measures. We regularly evaluate customers with significant settlement exposure to assess risk. In certain instances, we may require a customer to post collateral or provide other guarantees. If a customer becomes unable or unwilling to meet its obligations, we are able to draw upon such collateral or guarantee in order to minimize any potential loss. We may also apply other risk control measures, such as blocking the authorization and settlement of transactions, limiting the use of certain types of agents, prohibiting initiation of acquiring relationships with certain high-risk merchants or suspending or terminating a customers rights to participate in our payments network. The exposure to settlement losses is accounted for as a settlement risk guarantee. The fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated using our proprietary model. Key inputs to the model include the probability of customers becoming insolvent, statistically derived loss factors based on historical experience and estimated settlement exposures at period end.  Payment System Integrity  The integrity of our payments system is affected by fraudulent activity and other illegal uses of our products. Fraud is most often committed in connection with lost, stolen or counterfeit cards or stolen account information resulting from security breaches of systems that store cardholder or account data, including systems operated by merchants, financial institutions and other third-party data processors.  Our fraud detection and prevention offerings include Verified by Visa, a global internet authentication product, which permits cardholders to authenticate themselves to their issuing financial institution using a unique personal code; Visa Advanced Authorization, which adds additional fraud detection capability by adding real-time risk scores to authorization messages; and chip and PIN programs that have been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of certain types of fraud at physical point-of-sale locations. We have also implemented rules that require the use of more secure PIN encryption standards for ATMs and point-of-sale PIN entry devices installed after 2002 and 2003. We have also mandated that all PINs transmitted through VisaNet to the issuer be encrypted using the Triple DES, or Data Encryption Standard, by July 1, 2010.  Interchange Reimbursement Fees  Interchange represents a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in an open-loop payments network such as ours. On purchase transactions, interchange reimbursement fees are typically paid to issuers by acquirers in connection with transactions initiated with cards in our payments system. We set default interchange rates in the United States and other regions. In certain jurisdictions, interchange rates are subject to government regulation. Although we administer the collection and remittance of interchange reimbursement fees through the settlement process, we generally do not receive any portion of the interchange reimbursement fees. Interchange reimbursement fees are often the largest component of the costs that acquirers charge merchants in connection with the acceptance of payment cards. We believe that interchange reimbursement fees are an important driver of system volume.  We believe the interchange rates that we use promote the efficient operation of our payments network by enabling both the issuer and the acquirer to understand the economics of a given transaction before entering into it and by eliminating the need for each of our customers to negotiate transfer pricing with each other. By establishing and modifying default interchange rates in response to marketplace conditions and strategic demands, we seek to ensure a competitive value proposition for transactions using our cards in order to encourage electronic transactions and to maximize participation in the Visa payments system by issuers and acquirers and, ultimately, consumers and merchants. We believe that proper management of interchange rates benefits consumers, merchants,    11    Table of Contents  our customers and us by promoting the overall growth of our payments network in competition with other payment card systems and other forms of payment and creating incentives for innovation, enhanced data quality and security.  Interchange reimbursement fees and related practices also have come to the attention of, or have been or are being reviewed by, regulatory authorities and/or central banks in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States, the European Union, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Germany, Honduras, Hungary, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In certain countries, such as Australia and Mexico, interchange rates have been adjusted in advance of, or in response to, government regulation. We are currently devoting substantial management and financial resources to explain the importance of and defend interchange reimbursement fees and other legal and regulatory challenges we face relating to interchange reimbursement fees. See Item 1ARisk FactorsInterchange reimbursement fees and related practices are subject to significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide, which may have a material adverse impact on our revenues, our prospects for future growth and our overall business, and Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 21Legal Matters elsewhere in this report.  Merchant Discount Rates. Merchants do not pay interchange reimbursement fees. A merchants cost of acceptance is determined by its acquirer and is called a merchant discount or merchant discount rate. The merchant discount typically covers the costs that acquirers incur for participation in four-party payments networks, including those relating to interchange, and compensates them for various other services they provide to merchants. Merchant discount rates and other merchant fees are set by our acquirers without our involvement and by agreement with their merchant customers and are established in competition with other acquirers, other payment card systems and other forms of payment. We do not establish or regulate merchant discount rates or any other fees charged by our acquirers.  Government Regulation  We are subject to government regulation of the payments industry in many countries in which our cards are used. Our customers are also subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the United States and elsewhere, and as a consequence our business is affected by such regulations. For more information on government regulations that may affect our business, see Item 1ARisk Factors.  Intellectual Property  We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology.  We own a number of valuable trademarks and designs, which are essential to our business, including Visa, Interlink, PLUS, Visa Electron, the Winged V design, the Dove design and the Bands DesignBlue, White & Gold. We also own numerous other valuable trademarks and designs covering various brands, products, programs and services. Through agreements with our customers, we authorize and monitor the use of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network.  In addition, we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payments solutions, transaction processing, security systems and other matters.    12    Table of Contents Competition  We compete in the global payment marketplace against all forms of payment, including paper-based forms (principally cash and checks), card-based payments (including credit, charge, debit, ATM, prepaid, private-label and other types of general-purpose and limited-use cards) and other electronic payments (including wire transfers, electronic benefits transfers, automatic clearing house, or ACH, payments and electronic data interchange).  Within the general purpose payment card industry, we face substantial and intense competition worldwide in the provision of payments services to financial institution customers and their cardholder merchants. The leading global card brands in the general purpose payment card industry are Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Diners Club. Other general-purpose card brands are more concentrated in specific geographic regions, such as JCB in Japan and Discover in the United States. In certain countries, our competitors have leading positions, such as China UnionPay in China, which is the sole domestic inter-bank bankcard processor and operates the sole domestic bankcard acceptance mark in China due to local regulation. We also compete against private-label cards, which can generally be used to make purchases solely at the sponsoring retail store, gasoline retailer or other merchant.  In the debit card market segment, Visa and MasterCard are the primary global brands. In addition, our Interlink and Visa Electron brands compete with Maestro, owned by MasterCard, and various regional and country-specific debit network brands. In addition to our PLUS brand, the primary cash access card brands are Cirrus, owned by MasterCard, and many of the online debit network brands referenced above. In many countries, local debit brands are the primary brands, and our brands are used primarily to enable cross-border transactions, which typically constitute a small portion of overall transaction volume. See Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for financial information about geographic areas.  Based on payments volume, total volume, number of transactions and number of cards in circulation, Visa is the largest retail electronic payments network in the world. The following chart compares our network with those of our major general-purpose payment network competitors for calendar year 2008:                   Company   PaymentsVolume   TotalVolume   TotalTransactions   Cards      (billions)   (billions)   (billions)   (millions)   Visa Inc.(1)    $ 2,727   $ 4,346   56.7   1,717   MasterCard     1,900     2,533   29.9   981   American Express     673     683   5.3   92   Discover     106     120   1.6   57   JCB     63     68   0.7   60   Diners Club     30     31   0.2   7      (1)  Visa Inc. figures as reported on form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 29, 2009.

Visa figures include Visa, Visa Electron, and Interlink brands. The Visa card figure includes PLUS-only cards (with no Visa logo) in all regions except the United States, but PLUS cash volume is not included. Domestic China figures including commercial funds transfers are excluded. MasterCard includes PIN-based debit card figures on MasterCard cards, but not Maestro or Cirrus figures. American Express includes business from third-party issuers. JCB figures are for April 2007 through March 2008, but cards are as of September 2008. Transaction figures are estimates. Figures include business from third-party issuers.    13    Table of Contents Concentration of Business and Financial Information About Geographic Areas  For more information on the concentration of our operating revenues and for financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate, see Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 14Enterprise-wide Disclosures and Concentration of Business.  Working Capital Requirements  Payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring customers generally represents our most consistent and substantial liquidity requirement, arising primarily from the payments settlement of certain credit and debit transactions and the timing of payments settlement between financial institution customers with settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These settlement receivables and payables generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, consistent with standard market conventions for domestic transactions and foreign currency transactions. We maintain working capital sufficient to enable uninterrupted daily settlement. During fiscal 2009, we funded average daily net settlement receivable balances of $117 million, with the highest daily balance being $322 million.  Seasonality  We do not expect to experience any pronounced seasonality in our business. No individual quarter of fiscal 2009 or fiscal 2008 accounted for more than 30% of our fiscal 2009 or fiscal 2008 operating revenues.  Employees  At September 30, 2009, we employed approximately 5,700 persons worldwide. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
