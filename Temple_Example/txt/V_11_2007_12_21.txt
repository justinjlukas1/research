Visa operates the worlds largest retail electronic payments network and manages the worlds most recognized global financial services brand. We have more branded credit and debit cards in circulation, more transactions and greater total volume than any of our competitors. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. We provide financial institutions, our primary customers, with product platforms encompassing consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments. VisaNet, our secure, centralized, global processing platform, enables us to provide financial institutions and merchants with a wide range of product platforms, transaction processing and related value-added services. Based on the size of our network, the strength of the Visa brand and the breadth and depth of our products and services, we believe we are the leading electronic payments company in the world.  Our business primarily consists of the following:            we own a family of well known, widely accepted payment brands, including Visa, Visa Electron, PLUS and Interlink, which we license to our customers for use in their payment programs;            we manage and promote our brands for the benefit of our customers through advertising, promotional and sponsorship initiatives and by encouraging card usage and merchant acceptance;            we offer a wide range of branded payments product platforms, which our customers use to develop and offer credit, debit, prepaid and cash access programs for cardholders (individuals, businesses and government entities);            we provide transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing and settlement) to our customers through VisaNet, our secure, centralized, global processing platform;            we provide various other value-added services to our customers, including risk management, debit issuer processing, loyalty services, dispute management and value-added information services;            we develop new products and services to enable our customers to offer efficient and effective payment methods to their cardholders and merchants; and            we adopt and enforce a common set of rules adhered to by our customers to ensure the efficient and secure functioning of our payments network and the maintenance and promotion of our brands.    4    Table of Contents We derive revenues primarily from fees paid by our customers based on payments volume, transactions that we process and certain other related services that we provide. Payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services purchased with our cards, as reported by our customers. Cash volume generally includes cash access transactions, balance transfers and convenience check transactions associated with our products. Total volume, which we consider to be an important measure of the scale of our business, is the sum of payments volume and cash volume. An increasing portion of our revenues come from outside the United States, including Asia Pacific (AP) and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC), where macroeconomic and electronic payments trends provide attractive growth prospects.

Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks.    (3) Total transactions represents transactions involving our cards as reported by our customers and includes transactions that are not processed on our VisaNet processing system.    (4) Includes Bulgaria and Romania through March 31, 2007, after which time they became part of Visa Europe.  Our Reorganization  We completed a reorganization in October 2007. Prior to our reorganization, Visa operated as five corporate entities related by ownership and membership: Visa U.S.A., Visa International (comprising the operating regions of Asia Pacific (AP), Latin America and Caribbean (LAC), and Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (CEMEA)), Visa Canada, Visa Europe and Inovant, which operated the VisaNet transaction processing system and other related processing systems. Each of Visa U.S.A., Visa Canada, Visa Europe, Visa AP, Visa LAC and Visa CEMEA operated as a separate geographic region, serving its member financial institutions and administering Visa programs in its respective region.  In order to respond to industry dynamics and enhance Visas ability to compete, Visa undertook a reorganization in which Visa U.S.A., Visa International, Visa Canada and Inovant became direct or indirect subsidiaries of Visa Inc., a Delaware stock corporation. Visa Europe did not become a subsidiary of Visa Inc., but rather remained owned by its member financial institutions and entered into a set of contractual arrangements with Visa Inc. in connection with the reorganization. In the reorganization, we issued different classes and series of shares reflecting the different rights and obligations of Visa financial institution members and Visa Europe based on the geographic region in which they are located.  We believe that the reorganization provides us with several significant strategic benefits. It allows us to increase our operational efficiency and enhances our ability to deliver more innovative products and services to     5    Table of Contents  financial institutions, merchants and cardholders on a global basis. The reorganization allows us to centralize and streamline our strategy and decision making. We also believe that the reorganization and our proposed initial public offering will enable us to facilitate a common, global approach, where appropriate, to the legal, regulatory and competitive issues arising in todays marketplace. At the same time, we believe that the reorganization preserves and reinforces the advantages that have made Visa the largest retail electronic payments network in the world.  Industry Overview  The Global Payments Industry  We operate in the global payments industry, which is undergoing a major shift from paper-based payments, such as cash and checks, to card-based and other electronic payments. For more than 30 years, Visa has played a central role in driving this migration by providing payment products and services that we believe deliver significant benefits to consumers, businesses, governments and merchants. We believe that consumers are increasingly attracted to the convenience, security, enhanced services and rewards associated with electronic payment forms. We also believe that corporations and governments are shifting to electronic payments to improve efficiency, control and security, and that a growing number of merchants are accepting electronic payments to improve sales and customer convenience.  The global payments industry consists of all forms of payment and value transfer, including:            paper-based payments: cash, personal checks, money orders, government checks, travelers cheques, official checks and other paper-based means of transferring value;            card-based payments: credit cards, charge cards, debit cards, deferred debit cards, ATM cards, prepaid cards, private label cards and other types of general-purpose and limited-use cards; and            other electronic payments: wire transfers, electronic benefits transfers, automated clearing house payments and other forms of electronic payment not typically tied to a payment card or similar access device.    6    Table of Contents We believe that the shift to electronic payment forms is a worldwide phenomenon; however, in many developing countries, it is at an early stage and will be accelerated by rising incomes, globalization of commerce and increased travel. Recent innovations such as contactless cards and mobile payments are also increasing the attractiveness of electronic payments. We believe these trends create a substantial growth opportunity for the global payments industry. According to The Nilson Report, global card purchase transactions grew at a CAGR of 14% over the period from 2000 to 2006. The Nilson Report forecasts global card purchase transactions to increase at a CAGR of 11% from 2006 to 2012, with particularly strong growth in Asia/Pacific, Latin America and the Middle East/Africa:       Source: The Nilson Report, issue 866 (October 2006) and issue 885 (August 2007).  The most common card-based forms of payment are general-purpose cards, which are payment cards that permit widespread usage. General purpose cards are typically categorized as:            pay now cards, such as debit cards, which enable the cardholder to purchase goods and services by an automatic debit to a checking, demand deposit or other current account;            pay later cards, which typically permit a cardholder to carry a balance in a revolving credit account (a credit card or deferred debit card) or require payment of the full balance within a specified period (a charge card); and            pay before cards, such as prepaid cards, which are prefunded up to a certain monetary value.  The primary global general purpose card brands include Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, JCB and Diners Club. While these brandsincluding Visawere historically associated primarily with credit or charge cards in the United States and other major international markets, Visa and others have over time broadened their offerings to include debit, ATM, prepaid and commercial cards.  In addition to general purpose cards, a number of retailers and other entities issue limited-purpose credit, charge and prepaid cards that can be used for payment only at the issuing entity. These cards are generally referred to as private label cards. Private label cards are sometimes issued by a financial institution under a contractual agreement with the retailer.    7    Table of Contents Open-Loop Versus Closed-Loop Payments Networks  General purpose and limited-purpose payments networks primarily operate under two different business models. Open-loop payments networks, such as Visa and MasterCard, are multi-party and operate through a system that connects two financial institutionsone that issues the card to the cardholder, known as the issuing financial institution or issuer, and one that has the banking relationship with the merchant, known as the acquiring financial institution or acquirerand manages information and the flow of value between them. In a typical closed-loop payments network, the payment services are provided directly to merchants and cardholders by the owner of the network without involving third-party financial institution intermediaries. Closed-loop networks can range in size from networks such as American Express and Discover, which issue cards directly to consumers and serve merchants directly, to an individual merchant that issues limited-purpose private-label credit cards to its customers for use only in that merchants stores. In recent years, the major closed-loop networks have begun to develop relationships with financial institution issuers and acquirers, thereby emulating certain aspects of the open-loop networks.  Operators of open-loop networks such as Visa generally do not issue cards, set fees or determine interest rates that cardholders are charged for use of their cards. Issuers have the responsibility for determining these and many other card features. In addition, such networks generally do not solicit merchants directly or establish the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance, including the merchant discount rate. Both of these functions are generally the responsibility of acquirers. The following table outlines the major functions of each of the three major participants in the payments network.

Largest Operators of Open-Loop and Closed-Loop Retail Electronic Payments Networks  The largest operators of open-loop and closed-loop retail electronic payments networks are Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, JCB and Diners Club. With the exception of Discover, which primarily operates in the United States, all of the other network operators can be considered multi-national or global providers of payments network services. Based on payments volume, total volume, number of transactions and number of cards in circulation, Visa is the largest retail electronic payments network in the world.

American Express and Discover figures include business from third-party issuers. JCB figures are for October 2005 through September 2006 (fiscal year). JCB transaction figures are estimates.  Our Competitive Strengths  Worlds Largest Payments Network  We operate the worlds largest retail electronic payments network. Visa-branded cards are accepted in more than 170 countries around the world. We have more branded credit and debit cards in circulation, more transactions and greater total volume than any of our competitors. We believe that merchants, cardholders and our financial institution customers benefit from the Visa cardholder base, which is the largest in the world, and our merchant acceptance network, which is unsurpassed globally.  Leading Global Brand  Visa is the worlds most recognized global financial services brand. We believe merchants, consumers and our financial institution customers associate our brand with trust, security, reliability, efficiency, convenience and empowerment. Our deep base of local market knowledge enables us to tailor our product and marketing programs to the particular needs of specific geographies. We believe that the strength of our brand enables us to increase card usage in existing and new market segments, develop and offer innovative payment products and services and enhance the utility of our payments network for all participants.  Scalable and Unique Global Payments Processing Platform  We own and operate VisaNet, our secure, centralized, global processing platform. Unlike the processing platforms of some of our primary competitors, VisaNet is built on a centralized architecture rather than a distributed architecture, which enables us to provide real-time, value-added information to our customers. In addition, our centralized processing platform provides us the flexibility to develop, modify and enhance our products and services efficiently. VisaNet is highly reliable and processed more than 78 billion authorization, clearing and settlement requests in fiscal 2007. We believe that the operating efficiencies that result from the scale of our processing network provide us with a significant cost advantage over our competitors.  Comprehensive Payment Products and Services  We provide our financial institution customers with a comprehensive suite of electronic payment products and services. Our product platforms encompass credit, debit, cash access and prepaid products for consumers, businesses and governments. These product platforms enable our customers to develop and customize their own payment programs to meet the needs of their cardholders and merchants. We also offer our customers issuer processing to support our debit and prepaid platforms, and we are the largest issuer processor of Visa debit transactions in the world. Additionally, we offer a broad range of value-added services such as risk management, loyalty services, dispute management and value-added information services, which are enabled by our secure, centralized, global processing platform.  Established and Long-Standing Customer Relationships  We have long-standing relationships with the majority of our customers and long-term contracts with many of our major customers, which provide us with a significant level of business stability. More than two-thirds of our financial institution customers have been our customers for longer than 10 years. We believe that our many years of close cooperation with our customers in developing new products, processing capabilities and value-added services have enabled us to establish strong relationships. By virtue of these relationships, we believe that we are well-positioned to continue developing new products and services that anticipate the evolving needs of our customers.    10    Table of Contents Our Strategy  We seek revenue and profit growth by expanding our core payments business in new and established geographies and market segments, as well as by broadening our processing capabilities and value-added service offerings for payments and related opportunities. The key components of our strategy include:  Expand Our Network  We intend to continue to expand the size of our payments network in order to drive the issuance, acceptance and usage of our products globally. We intend to do this in several ways including:            Expand existing and build new relationships with financial institution customers. We will continue to use an integrated product strategy to increase our share of business with our existing financial institution customers and to build relationships with new customers. We believe that delivering world class service reinforces the value that Visa brings to our customers payments businesses and increases the issuance, acceptance and usage of our products. Our customer-driven service model includes integrated global account services coupled with local account support staff in each region in which we operate. We provide marketing, processing, risk and other consultative services, which enhance our customers business and support delivery of new Visa products and services.            Enhance the value of our products for merchants and cardholders. We continually enhance our products and services to meet the evolving needs of merchants and cardholders. Merchants are important to the growth of our business, and we seek to increase the value we bring to them in order to increase merchant acceptance and preference for Visa. We also seek to grow our network by encouraging active cardholder preference for Visa through continual improvement of the convenience, value and security of our products. By focusing on expanding the number of merchants and cardholders in our network, we increase the value we provide to our financial institution customers.  Expand into New and High Growth Geographies and Market Segments  We will continue to globalize our product and service offerings and to expand acceptance of our core products in key geographies and market segments.            Expand our presence in new geographies. As the largest retail electronic payments network, we are uniquely positioned to expand our global processing platform and the acceptance of our products and services in targeted geographies. We believe there is a significant opportunity to expand the usage of our products and services in high growth geographies in which we currently have a presence, such as AP, LAC and CEMEA. We intend to seek to expand the number of countries in which we provide value-added services, including risk management, debit issuer processing, loyalty services, dispute management and value-added information services.            Continue penetrating new consumer and merchant segments. We will continue to target and penetrate new consumer and merchant segments across all of our geographic markets, including the United States. We have introduced a full suite of product platforms and value-added services, which enable our customers to drive Visa products to the fast growing mass-market debit, affluent and small business segments. We will also continue to expand Visa acceptance in merchant segments that have traditionally not accepted electronic payments, such as quick-service restaurants and bill payment merchants.  Develop and Offer Innovative Products and Services  We will continue to provide new products and services and increase the functionality, utility and cost effectiveness of our existing products and services. VisaNet provides flexibility to quickly customize current offerings and rapidly develop, deploy and drive adoption of new products and services.    11    Table of Contents         Modify existing products. We will continue to upgrade or modify existing products to take advantage of market opportunities and generate growth. For example, modifying our rules to eliminate the signature requirements on small-value transactions in certain merchant segments has enabled us to rapidly increase acceptance and usage of current products at merchants where speed at the point-of-sale is a high priority. We will continue to seek such opportunities to expand acceptance and usage of products carrying our brands.            Develop new products. We believe there is also a significant opportunity to develop and offer new products. During the past two years, we have introduced several new varieties of prepaid cards and have enhanced our product offerings for the affluent consumer segment. We also intend to continue making significant investments in new technologies to strengthen our position in emerging forms of payment, including contactless and mobile devices.            Introduce new processing services. We intend to continue to introduce value-added processing services. We believe that by integrating enhanced capabilities, such as Visa Advanced Authorization (real-time transaction risk scoring), data reporting tools for commercial cards, loyalty applications and Visa ReadyLink, into our core offerings we can increase utility to customers and cardholders, capture additional revenues and differentiate ourselves from our competitors.  Strengthen and Grow Visas Brand Leadership   We will continue to invest in order to maintain Visas position as the worlds most recognized global financial services brand.            Focus on integrated brand investment. We make a combination of integrated global and local investments, using award-winning advertising campaigns, unique sponsorships, selected co-brand relationships and other promotional activities to increase consumer and business brand awareness and build active cardholder preference for Visa by reinforcing our core attributes of security, convenience, acceptance and differentiated products.            Maximize return on our brand investments. We seek to optimize the level and mix of spending across our media channels, sponsorships, co-brand relationships and other marketing properties to realize the maximum value from these arrangements.            Invest in and enhance our co-brand relationships and unique sponsorships. We work closely with our co-brand partners in airlines, hospitality, retail and other segments to create specific products and programs that complement our brand promise and deliver unique value propositions to cardholders. In addition, we maintain a unique portfolio of local and international sponsorships that create opportunities to deliver our brand message to consumers across the world.  Our Primary Operations  There are three core aspects of our business operations: transaction processing services, product platforms and payments network management.  Transaction Processing Services  Core Processing Services  Our core processing services involve the routing of payment information and related data to facilitate the authorization, clearing and settlement of transactions between Visa issuers, which are the financial institutions that issue Visa cards to cardholders, and acquirers, which are the financial institutions that offer Visa network connectivity and payments acceptance services to merchants. In addition, we offer a range of value-added processing services to support our customers Visa programs and to promote the growth and security of the Visa payments network.    12    Table of Contents Authorization is the process of approving or declining a transaction before a purchase is finalized or cash is disbursed. Clearing is the process of delivering final transaction data from an acquirer to an issuer for posting to the cardholders account, the calculation of certain fees and charges that apply to the issuer and acquirer involved in the transaction, and the conversion of transaction amounts to the appropriate settlement currencies. Settlement is the process of calculating, determining, reporting and transferring the net financial position of our issuers and acquirers for all transactions that are cleared.  Visa transactions can be authorized, cleared and settled either as dual-message transactions or as single-message transactions. The choice of processing method may vary depending upon the issuer, the type of card or the region in which the transaction takes place.            In a single-message transaction, the acquirer submits a single electronic message containing all data required for the authorization, clearing and settlement of the transaction. Actual financial settlement occurs at a later time.            In a dual-message transaction, the acquirer submits an electronic message at the time of purchase containing the information required for an authorization decision and a second message at a later point in time containing additional data required for clearing and settlement.  Authorization  A typical Visa transaction begins when the cardholder presents his or her Visa card to a merchant as payment for goods or services. The transaction information is then transmitted electronically to the issuer for authorization. In certain cases, we may authorize the transaction on behalf of the issuer through a service known as stand-in processing, based on parameters established by the issuer. The following diagram illustrates the processing steps involved in a typical transaction authorized through our network. In a typical Visa transaction, the authorization process by Visa occurs in approximately one second.           1. The cardholder presents the merchant with a Visa card for payment. The merchant point of sale terminal reads the account number and other data encoded on the cards magnetic stripe or chip.        2. The merchant terminal transmits the card information and transaction amount to the acquirer.        3. The acquiring financial institution or its third party processor combines the transaction information into an authorization request message and transmits it to Visa.        4. Visa routes the authorization request to the issuer for review. In certain circumstances, such as when the issuers systems are unavailable, Visa may perform stand-in processing and review and authorize or deny the transaction.        5. The issuing financial institution or its third party processor returns an authorization response message, either approving or denying the transaction to Visa.        6. Visa routes the authorization response to the acquirer.        7. The acquirer transmits the result of the authorization request to the merchant terminal.    13    Table of Contents Clearing and Settlement  Clearing occurs at the time of the authorization, for single-message transactions, or in a single daily batch message containing all transactions reported by the acquirer, for dual-message transactions. Settlement occurs on each business day and is conducted on a net basis for all transactions submitted during the previous settlement cycle. The following diagram illustrates the clearing and settlement process between the issuer and acquirer for a typical transaction processed through our system.     Clearing        1. The merchant transmits sales draft information for the transaction, including account numbers and transaction amounts, to the acquirer.        2. The acquiring financial institution or its third party processor formats this information into a clearing message, which it transmits to Visa.        3. Visa routes the clearing message to the card issuer and calculates the settlement obligation of the issuer and the amount due to the acquirer, net of certain applicable fees and charges.  Settlement        4. The issuer sends funds to Visas designated settlement bank in the amount of its settlement obligation.        5. The settlement bank, at the direction of Visa, transfers funds due to the acquirer.  The issuer and acquirer involved in a typical Visa transaction perform additional functions that we do not generally perform or monitor. For example, the acquirer credits the merchants account for the amount of the transaction less any fees the acquirer charges in accordance with the contractual agreement between the merchant and the acquirer. In addition, the issuer sends a statement to the cardholder and collects payment, in the case of a credit or deferred debit card, or collects payment directly from the cardholders deposit account, in the case of a debit card.  We process virtually all transactions within the United States, as well as all cross-border transactions, involving products carrying our brands. Outside of the United States and certain other countries, we do not process the majority of the domestic transactions (i.e., transactions where the issuer and the merchant are located in the same country) on products carrying our brands. Such transactions are generally processed by government-controlled payments networks, our financial institution customers, independent companies or joint ventures owned in whole or in part by our financial institution customers.  We perform clearing and settlement through our VisaNet system for transactions involving an issuer that is located in Visa Europes region and an acquirer that is located in the rest of the world, or vice versa. In addition, we currently provide clearing and settlement services for Visa transactions occurring entirely within Visa Europes region and will continue to provide such services until completion of deployment of Visa Europes own processing system. Visa Europe authorizes transactions for its members through its own processing system.    14    Table of Contents Other Value-Added Processing Services  The size of our network and our processing capabilities allow us to offer a range of other value-added services in certain countries. These services include risk management, debit issuer processing, loyalty services, dispute management and value-added information services.  Risk Management Services. Our centralized and integrated network architecture allows us to monitor, on a real-time basis, all transactions that we process for authorization. As a result, we provide customers in certain countries with a number of value-added risk-management services, which complement our core authorization services. Our risk management services provide preventive, monitoring, investigative and predictive tools, which are intended to mitigate and help eliminate fraud at the cardholder and merchant level. For example, Visa Advanced Authorization, which we introduced in 2005, enables us to monitor and evaluate VisaNet authorization requests in real-time and deliver enhanced transaction risk scores to issuers as part of the authorization message. It is the first system of its kind to deliver risk indicators in real-time by assessing transaction data on both an account level and a transaction level.  Debit Issuer Processing Services. Visa Debit Processing Services provides comprehensive processing services for participating United States issuers of Visa debit, prepaid and ATM payment products. In addition to core issuer authorization processing, Visa Debit Processing Services offers card management services, exception processing, PIN and ATM network gateways, call center services, fraud detection services and ATM terminal driving. Visa Debit Processing Services processes more Visa transactions than any other issuer processor in the world.  Loyalty Services. We offer loyalty services that allow our customers to enhance the attractiveness of their Visa payment programs and to strengthen their relationships with cardholders and merchants. These services are designed to allow our customers to differentiate their Visa program offerings, to support increased card usage and to increase the importance of Visa payments to merchants.  Visa Extras is a service that participating issuers may offer to their cardholders to increase card usage, enhance the value of their Visa programs and create stronger cardholder relationships. Visa Extras is a points-based program that rewards cardholders for using their enrolled Visa cards to make qualifying purchases. Cardholders can redeem points for rewards in the Visa Extras rewards catalog for everyday items such as movie tickets, retail gift certificates, merchandise, travel certificates, dining and other rewards.  The Visa Incentive Network enables merchants and financial institution customers to deliver tailored merchant offers to targeted groups of cardholders. Visa Incentive Network offers benefits traditionally associated with a closed-loop system. Visa Incentive Network was launched in April 2005 and allows us to deliver merchant promotions to affluent and high-spending Visa cardholders on behalf of participating issuers. Based on merchant-specific cardholder spending and location criteria for each promotion, we can analyze the spending patterns of Visa credit card holders in the United States about which information is provided to us by participating card issuers. We then deliver the promotion to the appropriate cardholders on behalf of these issuers. In order to protect cardholder privacy, the merchant does not gain access to cardholder information or underlying transaction data. The Visa Incentive Network database contains more than 80 million accounts. Visa Incentive Network is enabled through account level processing, which allows transactions to be processed and afforded customized treatment at the account leveli.e., by identifying each transaction by the entire 16-digit account numberrather than by the six-digit bank identification number, or BIN, as is the more typical industry practice. We are able to implement account level processing as a result of our reengineered Visa Integrated Payment platform, as described below.  Dispute Management Services. We manage Visa Resolve Online, an automated web-based service that allows our customers back-office analysts and customer service representatives to manage and resolve Visa transaction disputes more efficiently than with previous paper-based processes. Transaction disputes between issuers and acquirers sometimes arise from suspected fraud, merchant non-fulfillment of transaction requirements     15    Table of Contents  or other events. Visa Resolve Online, which is mandatory for all Visa customers, provides real-time access to Visa transaction data, electronic transfer of substantiating documents and automated management of communications between issuers and acquirers.  Value-Added Information Services. We provide our customers with a range of additional information-based business analytics and applications, as well as the transaction data and associated infrastructure required to support them. Through these services, we support and enhance our customers business intelligence capabilities, loyalty applications, operational and management performance metrics, transaction research and commercial card reporting.  Processing Infrastructure  We own and operate VisaNet, our secure, centralized, global processing platform, which consists of three synchronized processing centers. In addition, Visa Europe operates one processing center in the United Kingdom, which is part of our synchronized system in accordance with the terms of the framework agreement. In addition, we are building a new data center on the east coast of the United States. These centers are linked by a global telecommunications network, which is engineered for redundancy. Intelligent access points around the world complete our global processing infrastructure and enable merchants and financial institutions worldwide to access our core processing and value-added services.  In September 2006, we completed a five-year reengineering program, in which we, among other things, consolidated the authorization functions for our credit, debit, prepaid and ATM transactions into one technology platform called Visa Integrated Payment, or VIP. VIP is a modular processing platform, which is flexible and secure and combines global reach with the processing power to support our future growth and product innovation.  The following is a summary of critical attributes of our processing infrastructure:  Centralized Architecture. Unlike the processing platforms of some of our primary competitors, VisaNet is built on a centralized architecture rather than a distributed architecture. As a result, we are able to view and analyze each authorization transaction we process in real-time and can provide value-added information, such as risk scoring or loyalty applications, to the issuer while the transaction data is being routed through our system.  Redundancy. Our global telecommunications network and processing centers are designed for redundancy and fail-over. Our newest processing center houses multiple authorization engines, each supported by redundant power and telecommunications circuits. This new architecture complements our multiple processing center architecture, provides improved fail-over technology and helps to ensure that our VisaNet system is always available and has enough processing power to meet the growing demand for electronic payments.  Modular Architecture. In the VIP reengineering project that we completed in September 2006, we replaced a complex web of legacy code with a streamlined, layered, modular architecture. We believe that this new architecture significantly reduces the time, complexity and cost involved in adding functions or modifying the system to support emerging forms of payments, such as contactless and mobile payments. We also believe that this streamlined architecture was instrumental in our ability to implement account level processing on our systems in less than 12 months.  Processing Scale. During fiscal 2007, we processed more than 78 billion authorization, clearing and settlement requests. Based on tests that we conducted with IBM in July 2005, we estimate that VisaNet is capable of processing more than 12,000 transaction messages per second. We believe that the scale of our processing network provides us with a significant cost advantage over our competitors.    16    Table of Contents Product Platforms  We offer a broad range of product platforms to enable our customers to build differentiated, competitive payment programs for their consumer, business, government and merchant clients. Our principal payment platforms enable credit, charge, deferred debit, debit and prepaid payments, as well as cash access, for consumers, businesses and government entities. Our payment platforms are offered under our Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and PLUS brands.  Consumer Credit  Our consumer credit product platforms allow our issuers to offer deferred payment and financing products that can be customized to meet the needs of all consumer segments. Our baseline consumer credit platform is marketed to our issuers as Visa Traditional in the United States and Visa Classic in the rest of the world. We require issuers offering credit products based on this platform to meet minimum requirements for product functionality and to offer certain services, such as a reporting service for lost or stolen cards.  In addition, we offer premium credit platforms, which enable our issuers to tailor programs to consumers requiring higher credit lines or enhanced benefits, such as loyalty programs. Our premium consumer credit platforms are marketed to issuers, and in some cases, to cardholders, as Visa Gold, Visa Platinum, Visa Signature and Visa Infinite. Issuers offering these credit products are required to provide certain functionality and enhanced cardholder services that may vary by product and region. For example, we require that issuers provide a minimum level of cardholder rewards value and that they not impose a preset spending limit on Visa Signature cards.  We provide a number of additional services that many issuers choose to offer in conjunction with their Visa credit programs, even where we do not require the inclusion of such services. Certain of these services, such as emergency card replacement, travel assistance services and rental car insurance, are provided by third parties under contract with us.  Consumer Deposit Access  Our deposit access product platforms enable our issuers to offer consumer payment and cash access products that draw upon consumer deposit accounts, such as checking, demand deposit, asset or other pre-funded accounts. For the 12 months ended June 30, 2007, consumer debit and cash access products accounted for the majority of Visa transactions worldwide.  Consumer Debit  Visa Debit. Our primary consumer debit platform uses the Visa brand mark. Through our rules and product platform requirements, we further segment our Visa debit product platform into Visa Classic, Visa Gold, Visa Platinum and Visa Infinite, which allows our issuers to customize their Visa debit programs and offer a range of benefits to their debit cardholders.  Interlink Debit. We provide the Interlink debit product platform in the United States and certain countries in the AP region. Interlink is a single-message point-of-sale debit network. It generally requires a cardholder to enter a personal identification number, or PIN, for authentication. Interlink allows our issuers to provide a full range of debit card offerings to their deposit account customers. Interlink acceptance marks may be included on Visa debit cards or issued as standalone debit cards.  Visa Electron Debit. Visa Electron is a payment product platform that permits issuers to require all transactions initiated from the card to be authorized electronically. It is primarily used by issuers offering payment programs to higher risk customer segments or in countries where electronic authorization is less     17    Table of Contents  prevalent, such as certain markets in the AP, LAC and CEMEA regions. Visa Electron is primarily issued as a consumer debit product, but Visa Electron can also be issued as a credit or prepaid product for consumers or businesses.  POS Check Service. The Visa POS Check Service enables merchants to convert the account information on a consumers check into an electronic Visa transaction message at the point of sale if the check is drawn on a demand deposit account held at a participating Visa customer. This service, which is currently offered only in the United States, reduces the cost and time involved in merchant and financial institution processing of checks by taking advantage of Visas efficient electronic payments processing.  Cash Access  Our customers can provide global cash access to their cardholders by issuing products accepted at Visa and PLUS branded ATMs. Most Visa and Visa Electron branded cards offer customers cash access at ATMs, as well as at branches of our participating financial institution customers. The PLUS brand may also be included on issuers non-Visa branded cards to offer international cash access as a complement to domestic cash access services. We believe that more than one million Visa and PLUS branded ATMs are available in more than 170 countries. Payment cards may contain multiple cash access brand marks, in addition to Visa and PLUS, and transactions involving Visa and PLUS branded cards will generally be processed through our systems only if there is no regional or domestic ATM brand that is capable of processing the transaction.  Prepaid  Our prepaid product platform enables issuers to offer products that access a designated pool of funds, allowing cardholders to enjoy the convenience and security of a payment card in lieu of cash or checks. Our prepaid platform includes gift, travel, youth, payroll, money transfer, voucher replacement, corporate incentive, insurance reimbursement and government benefits cards. Our prepaid platforms are also used to pay highway tolls and to top up prepaid mobile phones in some regions. Prepaid products can be issued as either reloadable or disposable. Reloadable cards enable consumers or third parties such as employers to add additional funds to the pool. Consumers may reload cards through various channels, including merchants and participating financial institution customers. Disposable cards cannot be reloaded in this manner. Our prepaid cards can be distributed through a number of channels, including financial institution branches, Internet sites, merchants and employers.  Commercial  Our commercial product platforms enable multi-national, large, medium and small companies and government organizations to streamline payment processes, manage information and their supply chain, and reduce administrative costs. Our commercial platforms include Visa Business Credit, Visa Business Check Card, Visa Business Debit, Visa Signature Business, Visa Business Electron, Visa Corporate, Visa Purchasing, Visa Fleet, Visa Distribution, Visa Commercial One Card and Visa Commerce.  Large and Medium Companies and Government Organizations. The Visa Corporate product platform offers payment options for travel and entertainment charges, including cash advances, and provides detailed transaction data, which allows companies to track policy compliance and supplier management. Visa Purchasing provides corporate clients with a payment product to easily acquire the goods and services needed to conduct their business by streamlining time- and paper-intensive purchase order and invoice processing, and by providing flexible transaction authorization and verification statements for each cardholder. A sub-product of Visa Purchasing, Visa Fleet, provides specialized authorization controls that fleet operators need to monitor and manage spending for company-provided vehicles. Visa Distribution provides an accounts receivable service for suppliers with dispersed operations. The Visa Commercial One Card allows organizations to combine procurement, travel and entertainment, and fleet functionality into a single payment solution. Visa Commerce is a business-to-business electronic platform providing accounts payable and accounts receivable payment services to facilitate large transactions between contracted buyers and sellers.    18    Table of Contents Small Businesses. The Visa Business credit and debit platforms provide small businesses with cash flow tools, purchasing savings, rewards and management reporting. Visa Business Electron is an electronic authorization platform used in many countries outside North America and has authorization controls that are similar to those of the consumer Visa Electron products described above.  Core to all Visa Commercial payment platforms are information management, reconciliation and reporting, which integrate payment data into company financial systems. Visa Information Management is a web-based tool that provides access to a suite of reporting and information tools in multiple languages to companies using any of the Visa Commercial platforms.  Product Platform Innovation  We invest in the development and enhancement of payment product platforms with the goal of increasing the migration of consumer and business spending to electronic payments. We believe that innovation results in more secure and versatile payment program options for customers, merchants and consumers. We focus on new payment channels, card technologies, payment account access devices and authentication methods, and have recently made significant investments in the development of contactless payment cards and devices, mobile payments, chip cards, magnetic stripe and unembossed card enhancements, and money transfer.  Contactless Payment Cards and Devices. We support customer issuance and merchant acceptance of EMV-compliant contactless payment cards and devices, including contactless-enabled cards, minicards and microtags. A contactless device contains a computer chip that securely stores account information and transmits it to merchant terminals via secure radio-frequency technology that operates over short distances. Contactless devices can increase speed and convenience at the point of sale by allowing a consumer to complete a transaction without the need to swipe a card manually or insert it into a point-of-sale device. We believe that contactless technology is particularly appealing to merchants in segments with high point-of-sale throughput and a large proportion of small-value transactions.  Mobile Payments. We support payment origination and acceptance by mobile devices, such as mobile telephones and wireless data devices. In 2007, we introduced the Visa Mobile Platform, a global initiative that provides a comprehensive suite of technology tools and applications designed to promote product development and commercialization of mobile payment services. The Visa Mobile Platform is designed to provide consumers with a consistent experience for all types of payments, regardless of phone type or geography, and is designed to work within the existing infrastructure established by mobile carriers and financial institutions. In addition to supporting the development of mobile payment solutions, such as contactless payments, mobile Internet payments and person-to-person payment, the platform also supports the development of payment-related services, such as account management services to enable consumers to monitor account activity through a mobile device, and mobile coupons that can be redeemed at the point of sale.  Chip Cards. In certain regions and countries, we support customer issuance of Visa and Visa Electron chip cards, which are compliant with the EMV Integrated Circuit Card Specifications for Payment Systems. In addition to a traditional magnetic stripe, chip cards carry encrypted account data on an embedded computer chip that is read by a point-of-sale terminal. Chip cards can offer increased data security over traditional magnetic-stripe-only cards and can reduce the incidence of certain types of fraud.  Magnetic Stripe and Unembossed Card Enhancements. Beginning in October 2003, we introduced a series of rules and standards that allow our customers in certain regions to issue magnetic-stripe Visa cards with enhanced authorization requirements and risk controls that increase their ability to offer Visa cards to high-risk consumer segments. These standards include codes on the magnetic stripe that instruct point-of-sale terminals to request real-time transaction authorizations from the card issuer, providing an increased level of control over transaction authorization as compared to magnetic-stripe cards that lack such codes. These standards also permit issuers in certain countries to issue magnetic stripe Visa cards with the cardholder name and account number     19    Table of Contents  printed on the card, rather than embossed with raised lettering. These unembossed cards reduce the risk of fraudulent card use at merchants that do not have electronic point of sale terminals that are capable of seeking transaction authorizations from the card issuer.  Money Transfer. Visa Money Transfer is a remittance platform that our customers use to allow their cardholders to send funds to other Visa cardholders with accounts at participating financial institutions. The funds are credited directly to the individuals Visa credit, debit or prepaid account. Our customers can deploy our standard Visa Money Transfer service, which includes sophisticated anti-money laundering, fraud and risk controls, or they can develop their own customized services. Our customers also offer domestic and cross-border money transfer services using Visa prepaid cards in LAC, CEMEA and AP regions.  Payments Network Management   We devote significant resources to ensure that Visa is the payments network of choice for customers, merchants and cardholders. We seek to accomplish this by promoting our brand through marketing and sponsorship activities, increasing acceptance of Visa-branded cards around the world and ensuring that the system operates in a reliable and secure manner for all of our network participants.  Brand Management and Promotion  We engage in a variety of activities designed to maintain and enhance the value of our brand. Our integrated approach to brand management and promotion combines advertising, sponsorships, promotions and public relations to create programs that build active preference for products carrying our brand, promote product usage, increase product acceptance and support cardholder acquisition and retention. For merchants, we work to ensure that the Visa brand represents timely and guaranteed payment, as well as a way to increase their business profitably. For our customers, our marketing is designed to support their card issuance, activation and usage efforts while complementing and enhancing the value of their own brands. For cardholders, we work to ensure that Visa is a symbol of security, convenience and acceptance. By emphasizing these core attributes of our brand, we aim to reinforce the recognition that Visa is The Worlds Best Way to Pay.  Advertising plays a critical role in building brand awareness and equity, as well as communicating the benefits of our brand and Visa-branded payment products. Through our advertising campaigns, we strive to provide a consistent, recognizable and compelling message that supports our brand positioning. During 2006, we launched our Life Takes Visa brand campaign in the United States, reinforcing our brand promise to deliver innovative products and services that empower our cardholders to experience life and business their way and on their terms. In other regions, we promote these same brand messages through tailored regional and country-specific advertising campaigns, such as our All It Takes campaign in AP and our Porque La Vida es Ahora campaign in LAC.  We establish global marketing relationships to promote the Visa brand and to allow customers to conduct marketing programs in conjunction with major sporting and entertainment events. Through these marketing relationships, our customers may develop marketing programs that include the Visa brand and mention our sponsorship status. In addition, we engage in marketing and sponsorship activities around other national and local events or with associations and companies to provide customized marketing platforms to customers in certain countries and regions.  Our customer and business partner marketing consulting services provide customized advice and support to improve our customers cardholder acquisition, cardholder retention and product usage efforts. We conduct strategic reviews of our customers marketing activities and portfolio management practices, help them develop acquisition and retention programs, develop marketing for new products, conduct market segmentation analysis and perform other consultative services. In addition to customized consulting projects, we offer training to provide our customers with an understanding of best practices for managing their payments business.    20    Table of Contents We also provide marketing support to our customers through our support of Visa co-branded and affinity card programs. Co-branded cards are payment cards bearing the brand marks of an issuer and a marketing partner, usually a merchant, while affinity cards generally bear the marks or logos of charitable, professional, educational or civic organizations.  Our merchant marketing activities bring added value to our merchant partners through the development of marketing programs customized for specific merchants and industry segments. These programs, which we develop in conjunction with merchants, generate awareness for new acceptance channels and locations and increase cardholder spending and merchant sales revenue through special offers and promotions.  Merchant Acceptance Initiatives  Merchants play a vital role in our payments network, and we work continuously to build our merchant acceptance and enhance our relationships with merchants that accept Visa-branded cards. At June 30, 2007, our customers reported that our cards were accepted at more than 28 million merchant outlets around the world.  We aim to maintain and expand our merchant base by focusing on the needs of merchants and consumers and enhancing our programs to increase acceptance in attractive and fast-growing segments, such as bill payment. Our efforts to address these needs include supporting the development of technological innovations, delivering value-added information services, such as the Visa Incentive Network, and evaluating potential modifications to our operating rules and interchange rates to enhance the value of our payments network compared to other forms of payment. In the United States, for example, the Visa Small Ticket Payment Service provides a special interchange rate category and No Signature Required programs eliminate the requirement for a cardholder signature for certain small-value transactions in a number of everyday spend categories, including quick-service restaurants, movie theatres and public transit. Under this program, the merchant will be protected against no signature chargebacks. We believe these initiatives have resulted in a faster check-out process, a reduction in merchants operating expenses, increased merchant acceptance and greater transaction volume in these categories.  We enter into arrangements with certain merchants under which they receive monetary incentives and rebates for acceptance of products carrying our brands and increasing their payments volume of products carrying our brands or indicating a preference for our cards.  We continue to respond to the needs of merchants in order to enhance the efficiency of the Visa payments network for the benefit of all network participants. For example, in 2006, we enabled merchants in the United States to obtain copies of key provisions of our U.S. operating regulations, thereby increasing access to the rules and procedures that govern merchant participation in our system. We also published our U.S. interchange rate schedule and made our U.S. interchange rate qualification guide available to merchants in an effort to educate merchants about the structure of our customer interchange rates and the criteria that determine the specific rate for which a given transaction qualifies.  Customer Standards  Our financial institution customers participate in the Visa payments network through one of two ways. Financial institution customers that were members of either Visa U.S.A. or Visa International prior to the closing of our reorganization have remained members of those two entities, which continue to operate as non-stock subsidiaries of Visa Inc. Those financial institutions have non-equity membership interests in the applicable subsidiary, which represent the commercial and other rights and obligations with regard to participation in the Visa payments system. Our financial institution customers that were members of Visa Canada prior to the closing of our reorganization have entered into a series of agreements, which govern their commercial rights and obligations with respect to the Visa payments system.    21    Table of Contents Our customers are generally required to be financial institutions or other deposit-taking institutions organized under local banking laws or wholly-owned by such institutions. Certain of our customers participate in the full range of functions, such as soliciting cardholders and issuing cards, soliciting and signing merchants and acquiring merchant transactions. These financial institutions may also sponsor other financial institutions for more limited participation in our network.  Rulemaking and Enforcement  In general, our customers are granted licenses to use our brands and to access our transaction processing systems. Our customers are obligated to honor our rules and standards through agreements with, and in certain cases non-equity membership interests in, our subsidiaries. These rules and standards govern their use of our branded programs and their participation in our transaction processing system. Variations on such rules and standards may exist throughout the world in order to meet the needs of specific geographies. We require our customers to comply with these rules, which relate to such matters as the use of our brands and trademarks, the standards, design and features of payment cards and programs, merchant acquiring activities, including acceptance standards applicable to merchants, use of agents, disputes between members, risk management, guaranteed settlement, customer financial failures and allocation of losses among customers.  We establish dispute management procedures between customers relating to specific transactions. For example, after a transaction is presented to an issuer, the issuer may determine that the transaction is invalid for a variety of reasons, including fraud. If the issuer believes there is a defect in a transaction, the issuer may return, or charge back, the transaction to the acquirer. We enforce rules relating to chargebacks and maintain a dispute resolution process with respect to chargeback disputes.  Credit Risk Management  We indemnify our customers for any settlement loss suffered due to the failure of a customer to fund its daily settlement obligations. In certain instances we indemnify customers even in situations in which a transaction is not processed by our system. No material loss related to settlement risk has been incurred in recent years.  To manage our exposure in the event our customers fail to fund their settlement obligations, we have a credit risk policy with a formalized set of credit standards and risk control measures. Customers with significant settlement exposure are evaluated regularly to assess risk. In certain instances, we may require a customer to post collateral or provide other guarantees. If a customer becomes unable or unwilling to meet its obligations, we are able to draw upon such collateral or guarantee in order to minimize any potential loss. We may also apply other risk control measures, such as blocking the authorization and settlement of transactions, limiting the use of certain types of agents, prohibiting initiation of acquiring relationships with certain high risk merchants or suspending or terminating a customers rights to participate in our payments network. The exposure to settlement losses is accounted for as a settlement risk guarantee. The fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated using a proprietary model. Key inputs to the model include the probability of customers becoming insolvent, statistically derived loss factors based on historical experience and estimated settlement exposures at period end.  Payment System Integrity  The integrity of our payments system is affected by fraudulent activity and other illegal uses of our products. Fraud is most often committed in connection with lost, stolen or counterfeit cards or stolen account information resulting from security breaches of systems that store cardholder or account data, including systems operated by merchants, financial institutions and other third-party data processors. Fraud is also more likely to occur in association with transactions where the card is not present at the point of sale, such as electronic commerce, mail order and telephone order transactions. Security and cardholder authentication for these remote channels are particularly critical issues facing our customers and merchants that engage in these forms of commerce, where a signed cardholder sales receipt is generally unavailable.    22    Table of Contents Our fraud detection and prevention offerings include Verified by Visa, a global Internet authentication product, which permits cardholders to authenticate themselves to their issuing financial institution using a unique personal code; Visa Advanced Authorization, which adds additional fraud detection capability by adding real-time risk scores to authorization messages; and chip and PIN programs that have been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of certain types of fraud at physical point of sale locations. We have also implemented rules that require the use of more secure PIN encryption standards for ATMs and point-of-sale PIN entry devices installed after 2002 and 2003, and we have recently mandated that all PINs transmitted through VisaNet to the issuer be encrypted using the Triple DES, or Data Encryption Standard, by July 1, 2010.  In a 2006 cooperative industry effort, we co-founded the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards Council, an independent council that established security standards to protect cardholder data and to prevent fraud. In late 2006, we introduced a PCI compliance program with both incentives and fines targeted at our largest acquirers in order to improve compliance with the PCI standards by our largest U.S.-based merchants, which we refer to as Level I and Level II merchants. The initiatives goal is to eradicate the storage of prohibited account data, such as magnetic stripe (also known as track data), CVV2 (the three-digit security code on the back of the card) and PIN data, and to improve PCI compliance among this group of merchants. At September 30, 2007, 99% of Level I and Level II merchants had confirmed that they were not storing prohibited account data, and approximately two-thirds of the Level I merchants and almost 45% of the Level II merchants had certified their compliance with the PCI standards.  In 2006, we began upgrading all connections to VisaNet with encryption capabilities to protect data that is transferred to and from VisaNet, and began performing data content analysis to ensure proper data safe-keeping and purging of obsolete data. In 2006, we also began developing a web-based tool that will replace our legacy risk-identification system to better assist customers in their identification and monitoring of high-risk relationships.  Interchange  Interchange represents a transfer of value between the financial institutions participating in an open-loop payments network such as ours. On purchase transactions, interchange fees are typically paid to issuers by acquirers in connection with transactions initiated with cards in our payments system. We set default interchange rates in the United States and other regions. In certain jurisdictions, interchange rates are subject to government regulation. Although we administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process, we generally do not receive any portion of the interchange fees. Interchange fees are often the largest component of the costs that acquirers charge merchants in connection with the acceptance of payment cards. We believe that interchange fees are an important driver of system volume.  We believe the default interchange rates that we use promote the efficient operation of our payments network by enabling both the issuer and acquirer to understand the economics of a given transaction before entering into it, and by eliminating the need for each of our customers to negotiate transfer pricing with each other. By establishing and modifying default interchange rates in response to marketplace conditions and strategic demands, we seek to ensure a competitive value proposition for transactions using our cards in order to encourage electronic transactions and to maximize participation in the Visa payments system by issuers and acquirers and, ultimately, consumers and merchants. We believe that proper management of interchange rates benefits consumers, merchants, our customers and us by promoting the overall growth of our payments network in competition with other payment card systems and other forms of payment, and creating incentives for innovation, enhanced data quality and security.  Interchange fees and related practices also have been or are being reviewed by regulatory authorities and/or central banks in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States, European Union, Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Germany, Honduras, Hungary, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In certain countries, such as     23    Table of Contents  Australia and Mexico, interchange rates have been adjusted in advance of, or in response to, government regulation. We are currently devoting substantial management and financial resources to explain the importance of and defend interchange fees and other legal and regulatory challenges we face relating to interchange fees. See Item 3Legal ProceedingsOther Legal and Regulatory ProceedingsGlobal Interchange Proceedings and Item 1ARisk FactorsInterchange fees are subject to significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide, which may have a material adverse impact on our revenues, our prospects for future growth and our overall business.  Merchant Discount Rates. Acquirers generally charge merchants a fee for each transaction, called a merchant discount. This fee would typically cover costs they incur for participation in four-party payments networks, including those relating to interchange, and compensate them for various other services they provide to merchants. Merchant discount rates and other merchant fees are set by our acquirers without our involvement and by agreement with their merchant customers and are established in competition with other acquirers, other payment card systems and other forms of payment. We do not establish or regulate merchant discount rates or any other fees charged by our acquirers.  Intellectual Property  We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology.  We own a number of valuable trademarks and designs, which are essential to our business, including Visa, Interlink, PLUS, Visa Electron, the Winged V design, the Dove design and the Bands DesignBlue, White & Gold design. We also own numerous other valuable trademarks and designs covering various brands, products, programs and services. Through agreements with our customers, we authorize and monitor the use of our trademarks in connection with their participation in our payments network.  In addition, we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payments solutions, transaction processing, security systems and other matters.  Competition  We compete in the global payment marketplace against all forms of payment, including paper-based forms (principally cash and checks), card-based payments (including credit, charge, debit, ATM, prepaid, private-label and other types of general purpose and limited use cards) and other electronic payments (including wire transfers, electronic benefits transfers, ACH payments and electronic data interchange).  Within the general purpose payment card industry, we face substantial and intense competition worldwide. The leading global card brands in the general purpose payment card industry are Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Diners Club. Other general purpose card brands are more concentrated in specific geographic regions, such as JCB in AP and Discover in the United States. In certain countries, our competitors have leading positions, such as JCB in Japan and China UnionPay in China, which is the sole domestic payment processor and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark in China due to local regulation. We also compete against private-label cards, which can generally be used to make purchases solely at the sponsoring retail store, gasoline retailer or other merchant.  In the debit card market segment, Visa and MasterCard are the primary global brands. In addition, our Interlink and Visa Electron brands compete with Maestro, owned by MasterCard, and various regional and country-specific debit network brands, such as STAR, owned by First Data Corporation, PULSE, owned by Discover, NYCE, owned by Metavante Corporation, and others in the United States, Interac in Canada, and EFTPOS in Australia. In addition to our PLUS brand, the primary cash access card brands are Cirrus, owned by     24    Table of Contents  MasterCard, and many of the online debit network brands referenced above. In many countries, local debit brands are the primary brands, and our brands are used primarily to enable cross-border transactions, which typically constitute a small portion of overall transaction volume.  Some of our major competitors, including American Express and Discover, operate closed-loop systems. Closed-loop systems can benefit from direct access to consumer and merchant information, and they tend to have greater control over cardholder service than do operators of open-loop payments networks, like Visa, which depend on their financial institution customers to provide products and services directly to the cardholder. In recent years, the major closed-loop systems, American Express and Discover, have begun working directly with issuing and acquiring financial institutions, thus emulating certain aspects of the open-loop system, including setting transfer pricing.  In addition, we compete against companies that are developing and implementing alternative payments networks. Among other things, these competitors provide Internet currencies, which can be used to buy and sell goods online, virtual checking programs, which permit the direct debit of consumer checking accounts for both online and point-of-sale transactions and services that support payments to and from proprietary accounts for Internet, mobile commerce and other applications. A number of these new entrants rely principally on the Internet to support their services and may enjoy lower costs than we do. In mobile commerce, we also face competition from established network operators that may be in a position to enable mobile devices to process electronic payments or transfer money, and to use their existing billing systems to process these payments and transfers between their customers and third parties without our involvement.  Our Visa Debit Processing Service is the largest provider of issuer processing services for United States issuers of Visa debit, prepaid and ATM products, and thus also competes with third party processors, such as First Data Corporation and TSYS.  We believe that the primary factors affecting our competitive position in the payments industry include:            our ability to maintain the quality and integrity of our transaction processing systems;            our relationships with our customers;            our relationships with merchants;            the impact of existing litigation, legislation and government regulation;            pricing to our customers;            the impact of globalization and consolidation of financial institutions and merchants; and            our ability to develop and implement new payment programs, systems and technologies.  Litigation has and may continue to affect our ability to compete in the global payments industry. For example, as a result of the June 2003 settlement of a U.S. merchant lawsuit against Visa U.S.A. and MasterCard, merchants may choose not to accept U.S.-issued Visa debit cards in the United States while still accepting Visa-branded credit cards, and vice versa. In addition, following the final judgment in our DOJ litigation, members of Visa U.S.A. may issue certain payment cards that compete with Visa-branded cards, such as American Express or Discover, while remaining Visa members. Since this final judgment, several members of Visa U.S.A., including, but not limited to, Bank of America, Citibank, HSBC/Metris, U.S.A.A., Barclaycard U.S., GE Consumer Finance, Inc., First Bank & Trust, Central National Bank & Trust and Brenham National Bank, have begun to issue, or have announced that they will issue, American Express or Discover-branded cards. Outside of the United States, our customers have historically been permitted to issue American Express cards, as well as the cards of other competing general purpose card networks.    25    Table of Contents The banking industry has undergone consolidation, and we expect this trend to continue. A major financial institution customer may be acquired by an institution that has a strong relationship with a competitor, resulting in a substantial loss of business. Because continued consolidation in the banking industry results in fewer financial institutions of increased size, the bargaining power of the remaining financial institutions increases.  Government Regulation  Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are subject to government regulation of the payments industry in many countries in which our cards are used. Our customers are also subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the United States and elsewhere, and as a consequence our business is affected by such regulations. In recent years our business has come under increasing regulatory scrutiny. In particular, interchange fees associated with open-loop payments systems such as ours are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions in which our cards are used.  As the volume of card-based payments has increased in recent years, interchange fees, including our default interchange rates, have become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny worldwide. We believe that regulators are increasingly adopting a similar approach to interchange fees, and, as a result, developments in any one jurisdiction may influence regulatory approaches in other jurisdictions. Interchange fees have been the topic of recent committee hearings in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, as well as conferences held by a number of U.S. federal reserve banks. In addition, the U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bill that would commission a study by the Federal Trade Commission of the role of interchange fees in alleged price gouging at gas stations. Individual state legislatures in the United States are also reviewing interchange fees, and legislators in a number of states have proposed bills that purport to limit interchange fees or merchant discount rates or to prohibit their application to portions of a transaction. In addition, the Merchants Payments Coalition, a coalition of trade associations representing businesses that accept credit and debit cards, is mounting a challenge to interchange fees in the United States by seeking legislative and regulatory intervention.  Interchange fees and related practices also have been or are being reviewed by regulatory authorities and/or central banks in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States, European Union, Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Germany, Honduras, Hungary, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In certain countries, such as Australia and Mexico, interchange rates have been adjusted in anticipation of, or in response to, government regulation.  Most jurisdictions in which we and our customers operate have implemented, amended or have pending anti-money laundering regulations. In 2002, we and our customers became subject to the provisions of the U.S.A. PATRIOT Act, which requires the creation and implementation of comprehensive anti-money laundering programs. In general, this requires that we make certain efforts to prevent our payments system from being used to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities, including, for example, the designation of a compliance officer, training of employees, adoption of internal policies and procedures to mitigate money laundering risks, and periodic audits.  We are subject to regulations imposed by OFAC. OFAC restricts financial dealings with Cuba, Iran, Myanmar and Sudan, as well as financial dealings with certain restricted third parties, such as identified money laundering fronts for terrorists or narcotics traffickers. While we prohibit financial institutions that are domiciled in those countries or are restricted parties from being Visa members, many Visa International members are non-U.S. financial institutions, and thus are not subject to OFAC restrictions. Accordingly, our payments network may be used with respect to transactions in or involving countries or parties subject to OFAC-administered sanctions.    26    Table of Contents In recent years, a number of regulations relating to the price of credit and directed at our financial institution customers have been implemented in some jurisdictions in which our cards are used. In the United States, regulators and the U.S. Congress have increased their scrutiny of our customers pricing and underwriting standards relating to credit. For example, a number of regulations have been issued to implement the U.S. Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, and other regulations are expected to be issued in 2007. One such regulation pertaining to risk-based pricing could have a significant impact on the application process for credit cards and result in increased costs of issuance and/or a decrease in the flexibility of card issuers to set the price of credit. Another such regulation is a significant proposal to amend Regulation Z, which implements the Truth-in-Lending Act, and will change the substance and format of consumer disclosures made by financial institutions. In addition, the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and other Committees and Subcommittees may continue to consider the methods used to calculate finance charges and allocate payments received from cardholders and the methods by which default interest rates, late fees and over-the-credit-limit fees are determined, imposed and disclosed. Any regulation in this regard could impact our customers ability to issue cards profitably in certain segments and impact our payments volume and revenues.  We and our customers are subject to regulations related to privacy, data use and security in the jurisdictions in which we do business. For example, in the United States, our customers and we are respectively subject to the banking regulators information safeguard rules and the Federal Trade Commissions rules under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, respectively. These rules require that our customers and we develop, implement and maintain written, comprehensive information security programs containing safeguards that are appropriate to our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue.  In recent years, there has been a heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data security. In the United States, a number of bills have been introduced in Congress and there have been several Congressional hearings to address these issues. Congress is considering data security/data breach legislation which, if implemented, could affect our customers and us. In addition, a number of U.S. states have enacted security breach legislation, requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach, and several other states are considering similar legislation.  Governments in certain countries have acted, or could act, to provide resources or protection to selected national payment card providers or national payment processing providers to support domestic competitors or to displace us from, prevent us from entering into, or substantially restrict us from participating in, particular geographies. For example, our customers in China are not permitted to issue cards carrying our brands for domestic use in China. Governments in certain other countries have considered similar restrictions from time to time.  Many jurisdictions in which our customers and we operate are considering, or are expected to consider, legislation with regard to Internet transactions, and in particular with regard to choice of law, the legality of certain e-commerce transactions, the collection of applicable taxes and copyright and trademark infringement. If implemented, these initiatives could require our customers and us to monitor, filter, restrict or otherwise oversee various categories of payment card transactions or to take other actions. For example, draft regulations were proposed on October 1, 2007 pursuant to recently enacted U.S. legislation regarding Internet gambling, which will require our customers and us to code and block certain types of Internet gambling transactions. Comments on these draft regulations were due December 12, 2007 and final regulations will be forthcoming at an undetermined date. Various U.S. regulatory agencies are also considering additional regulation covering capital requirements, privacy, disclosure rules, security and marketing, which could impact our customers and us directly. Increases in fraud or other illegal activity involving our cards could also lead to regulatory intervention, such as mandatory card re-issuance.  Certain of our operations in the United States are periodically reviewed by the Federal Financial Institution Examination Council to ensure our compliance with applicable data integrity and security requirements, as well as other requirements applicable to us as a result of our role as a service provider to financial institutions. In     27    Table of Contents  recent years, the federal banking regulators in the United States have adopted a series of regulatory measures intended to require more conservative accounting, greater risk management and higher capital requirements for bank credit card activities, particularly in the case of banks that focus on subprime cardholders. Government regulators may determine that we are a systemically important payments system and impose settlement risk management requirements on us, including new settlement procedures or other operational rules to address credit and operational risks or new criteria for customer participation and merchant access to our payments system. In addition, outside of the United States, a number of jurisdictions have implemented legal frameworks to regulate their domestic payments systems. For example, regulators in Australia, Mexico, Colombia, India, Singapore and Malaysia have been given statutory authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in those countries.  See Item 1ARisk FactorsLegal and Regulatory RisksThe payments industry is the subject of increasing global regulatory focus, which may result in costly new compliance burdens being imposed on us and our customers and lead to increased costs and decreased payments volume and revenues, Interchange fees are subject to significant legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide, which may have a material adverse impact on our revenues, our prospects for future growth and our overall business and Existing and proposed regulation in the areas of consumer privacy and data use and security could decrease the number of payment cards issued, our payments volume and revenues.  Employees  At September 30, 2007, we employed 5,479 persons worldwide. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good.  Customers  At September 30, 2007, we had approximately 16,600 financial institution customers. Operating revenues recognized as a result of fees paid, net of incentives, from our largest customer, JPMorgan Chase and its affiliates, were $408 million in fiscal 2006 and $454 million in fiscal 2007, representing 10% and 9% of our pro forma operating revenues in each such period. No other customer represented more than 10% of our pro forma operating revenues.
