Company Background  Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively "Apple" or the "Company") design, manufacture, and market personal computers, portable digital music players, and mobile communication devices and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Macintosh ("Mac"), iPod and iPhone compatible products, including application software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and peripherals through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to education, consumer, creative professional, business, and government customers. The Company's fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. Unless otherwise stated, all information presented in this Form 10-K is based on the Company's fiscal calendar.  Business Strategy  The Company is committed to bringing the best personal computing, portable digital music and mobile communication experience to students, educators, creative professionals, businesses, government agencies, and consumers through its innovative hardware, software, peripherals, services, and Internet offerings. The Company's business strategy leverages its unique ability to design and develop its own operating system, hardware, application software, and services to provide its customers new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration, and innovative industrial design. The Company believes continual investment in research and development is critical to the development and enhancement of innovative products and technologies. In addition to evolving its personal computers and related solutions, the Company continues to capitalize on the convergence of the personal computer, digital consumer electronics and mobile communications by creating and refining innovations, such as the iPod, iPhone, iTunes Store, and Apple TV. The Company's strategy also includes expanding its distribution network to effectively reach more of its targeted customers and provide them with a high-quality sales and post-sales support experience.  Digital Lifestyle  The Company believes that for both professionals and consumers the personal computer has become the center of an evolving digital lifestyle by integrating with and enhancing the utility of advanced digital devices such as the Company's iPods, iPhones, digital video and still cameras, televisions, personal digital assistants, and other digital devices. The attributes of the personal computer that enable this functionality include a high-quality user interface, easy access to relatively inexpensive data storage, the ability to run complex applications, and the ability to connect easily to a wide variety of other digital devices and to the Internet. The Company is the only participant in the personal computer industry that controls the design  1      and development of the entire personal computerfrom the hardware and operating system to sophisticated software applications. This, along with its products' creative industrial designs, intuitive ease-of-use, and built-in graphics, multimedia and networking capabilities, positions the Company to offer innovative integrated digital lifestyle solutions.  Expanded Distribution  The Company believes a high-quality buying experience with knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the Company's products and services greatly enhances its ability to attract and retain customers. The Company sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, education customers, and businesses through its retail and online stores. The Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales, including the Apple Sales Consultant Program, which places Apple employees and contractors at selected third-party reseller locations. The Company believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an efficient way to demonstrate the advantages of its Mac computers and other products over those of its competitors.  At the end of fiscal 2007, the Company had opened a total of 197 of its own retail stores, including 174 stores in the U.S. and a total of 23 stores in Canada, Japan, U.K. and Italy. The Company has typically located its stores at high-traffic locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping districts.  One of the goals of the retail initiative is to expand the Company's installed base through sales to customers who currently do not already own the Company's products. By operating its own stores and locating them in desirable high-traffic locations, the Company is better positioned to control the customer buying experience and attract new customers. The stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and marketing of the Company's products and related solutions. To that end, retail store configurations have evolved into various sizes in order to accommodate market-specific demands. The stores employ experienced and knowledgeable personnel who provide product advice and certain support services. The stores offer a wide selection of third-party hardware, software, and various other accessory products and peripherals selected to complement the Company's own products.  Education  Throughout its history, the Company has focused on the use of technology in education and has been committed to delivering tools to help educators teach and students learn. The Company believes effective integration of technology into classroom instruction can result in higher levels of student achievement, especially when used to support collaboration, information access, and the expression and representation of student thoughts and ideas. The Company has designed a range of products and services to address the needs of education customers. These products and services include the Company's Mac computers, iPods, iTunes, and Apple TV, in addition to various solutions for video creation and editing, wireless networking, professional development, and one-to-one (1:1) learning. A 1:1 learning solution typically consists of a portable computer for every student and teacher along with the installation of a wireless network.  Creative Professionals  Creative professionals constitute one of the Company's most important markets for both hardware and software products. This market is also important to many third-party developers who provide Mac-compatible hardware and software solutions. Creative customers utilize the Company's products for a variety of activities including digital video and film production and editing; digital video and film special effects, compositing and titling; digital still photography and workflow management; graphic design, publishing, and print production; music creation and production; audio production and sound design; and web design, development, and administration.  The Company designs its high-end hardware solutions, including servers, desktops, and portable Mac systems, to incorporate the power, expandability, and features desired by creative professionals. The Company's operating system, Mac OS X, incorporates powerful graphics and audio technologies and  2       features developer tools to optimize system and application performance when running creative solutions provided by the Company or third-party developers.  Other  In addition to consumer, education and creative professional markets, the Company provides hardware and software products and solutions for customers in the information technology, science, business, and government markets.  Business Organization  The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments do not include activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America.

Markets and Distribution  The Company's customers are primarily in the education, creative professional, consumer, and business markets. The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers and cataloguers. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2007, 2006, or 2005. The Company also sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, education customers, and businesses through its own sales force and retail and online stores.  Competition  The Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. The markets for consumer electronics, personal computers, related software and peripheral products, digital music devices and related services, and mobile communication devices are highly competitive. These markets are characterized by rapid technological advances in both hardware and software that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of personal computers, other digital electronic devices, and mobile communication devices that have resulted in the frequent introduction of new products with competitive price, feature, and performance characteristics. Over the past several years, price competition in these markets has been particularly intense. The Company's competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. The Company's financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. The principal competitive factors include price, product features, relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, availability of software and peripherals, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller, simpler, and less expensive than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the Company's products.  The Company's music products and services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services, including those offering free peer-to-peer music and video services. The Company believes it currently retains a competitive advantage by offering superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware (personal computer and iPod), software (iTunes), and distribution of content (iTunes Store and iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store). However, the Company expects competition in this space to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company's approach to tightly integrating these elements within their own offerings or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more integrated than those they currently offer. Some of these current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Company's offerings.  The Company is currently focused on market opportunities related to mobile communication devices including the iPhone. The mobile communications industry is highly competitive with several large, well-funded, and experienced competitors. The Company faces competition from mobile communication device companies that may attempt to imitate some of the iPhone's functions and applications within their own smart phones. This industry is characterized by aggressive pricing practices, frequent product introductions, evolving design approaches and technologies, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers.  The Company's future financial condition and operating results are substantially dependent on the Company's ability to continue to develop improvements to the Mac platform and to the Company's  10       hardware, software and services related to consumer electronic devices, including iPods, and mobile communication devices, including iPhone.  Raw Materials  Although most components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including, but not limited to, microprocessors, enclosures, certain LCDs, certain optical drives, and application-specific integrated circuits ("ASICs") are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some key components, while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability constraints and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some components uncommon to the rest of the personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries, and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. If the supply of a key or single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipment of completed products to the Company, the Company's ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company's business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be affected if suppliers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. The Company attempts to mitigate these potential risks by working closely with these and other key suppliers on product introduction plans, strategic inventories, coordinated product introductions, and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. The Company's purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days.  The Company believes there are several component suppliers and manufacturing vendors whose loss to the Company could have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business and financial condition. At this time, such vendors include Agere Systems, Inc., Ambit Microsystems Corporation, Amperex Technology Limited, ASUSTeK Corporation, ATI Technologies, Inc., Atheros Communications Inc., AU Optronics Corporation, Broadcom Corporation, Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corporation, Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Infineon Technologies AG, Intel Corporation, Inventec Appliances Corporation, LG. Phillips Co., Ltd., Matsushita, Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd., National Semiconductor Corporation, NVIDIA Corp., Inc., Quanta Computer, Inc., Renesas Semiconductor Co. Ltd., Samsung Electronics, Sony Corporation, Synaptics, Inc., Texas Instruments, and Toshiba Corporation. Certain of these vendors are the sole-sourced supplier of components and manufacturing outsourcing for many of the Company's key products, including but not limited to, assembly of most of the Company's portable Mac computers, iPods, and iPhones.  Research and Development  Because the personal computer, consumer electronics, and mobile communication industries are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company's ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services, and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products in the areas of computer hardware and peripherals, consumer electronics products, mobile communication devices, system software, applications software, networking and communications software and solutions, and Internet services and solutions. The Company may expand the range of its product offerings and intellectual property through licensing and/or acquisition of third-party business and technology. The Company's research and development expenditures totaled $782 million, $712 million, and $535 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.  11      Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses  The Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its computer systems, iPods, iPhone, peripherals, software, and services. In addition, the Company has registered, and/or has applied to register, trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries for "Apple," the Apple logo, "Macintosh," "Mac," "iPod," "iTunes," "iTunes Store," "iPhone," and numerous other trademarks and service marks. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence, and marketing abilities of its personnel.  Many of the Company's products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third-parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms; however, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained at all. Because of technological changes in the computer industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Company's products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third-parties.  Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic Data  The U.S. represents the Company's largest geographic marketplace. Approximately 60% of the Company's net sales in 2007 came from sales to customers inside the U.S. Final assembly of products sold by the Company is currently performed in the Company's manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fremont, California; Fullerton, California; Taiwan; the Republic of Korea ("Korea"); the People's Republic of China ("China"); and the Czech Republic. Currently, the supply and manufacture of many critical components used in the Company's products is performed by sole-sourced third-party vendors in the U.S., China, Japan, Korea, and Singapore. Final assembly of substantially all of the Company's portable products, including MacBook Pro, MacBook, iPod, and iPhone, is performed by sole-sourced third-party vendors in China. Margins on sales of the Company's products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties.  Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K and in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 9, "Segment Information and Geographic Data."  Seasonal Business  The Company has historically experienced increased net sales in its first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the beginning of the school year. This historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's future net sales or financial performance.  Warranty  The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products, including Mac computers, iPods and iPhones. The basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Company's hardware products. In addition, consumers may purchase extended service coverage on most of the Company's hardware products in all of its major markets.  12         Backlog  In the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions as dealers anticipate shortages. Backlog is often reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.  Environmental Laws  Compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has to date had no material effect on the Company's capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. In the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the Company.  Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates including various countries within Europe and Asia, certain Canadian provinces and certain states within the U.S. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or operating results.  Employees  As of September 29, 2007, the Company had approximately 21,600 full-time equivalent employees and an additional 2,100 temporary equivalent employees and contractors.
